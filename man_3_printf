.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Function that produces output according to a format.

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
_printf() Prints to standard output using a
.I format
string that specifies how to convert the subsequent arguments.
.SH Return value
In cases of successful, return these functions return the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings)

If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.rd
.SH Format of the string
The format string is composed of 0 or more directives (ordinary characters that are not %). The format string is also composed of conversion specifications. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character % and ends with the conversion specifier.
The argument must correspond properly with the conversion specifier.

.SH The conversion specifier
A character specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion types are as follows:
.TP
.BR c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, then the return character is written.
.TP
.B s
The const char * argument is a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). The characters in the array do not include the final null byte.
